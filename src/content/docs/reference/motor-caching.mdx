Motor Caching is a performance optimization feature in CoreControl. It reduces the number of unnecessary hardware write operations, which can significantly improve loop times, especially when using many motors or servos.

## Overview

In the FTC SDK, every time you set a motor's power or a servo's position, a command is sent to the hardware controller (Control Hub or Expansion Hub). This communication takes time. If you set the same power value repeatedly in a loop (e.g., `motor.power = 1.0` every loop), you are wasting valuable time sending redundant commands.

CoreControl provides extension properties (`cachingPower`, `cachingPosition`) that check the current value before writing a new one. If the new value is effectively the same as the current one (within a small tolerance), the write operation is skipped.

## Usage

Simply replace `.power` with `.cachingPower` and `.position` with `.cachingPosition` in your code.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    // Instead of this:
    motor.power = 1.0
    servo.position = 0.5

    // Use this:
    motor.cachingPower = 1.0
    servo.cachingPosition = 0.5
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    // Instead of this:
    motor.setPower(1.0);
    servo.setPosition(0.5);

    // Use this:
    Caching.setCachingPower(motor, 1.0);
    Caching.setCachingPosition(servo, 0.5);
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## API Reference

### DcMotor / DcMotorEx

**Extension Property:** `cachingPower`

*   **Type:** `Double`
*   **Behavior:** Writes to `power` only if the new value differs from the current value by more than `0.009`. Always writes if the new value is exactly `0.0`.

### Servo

**Extension Property:** `cachingPosition`

*   **Type:** `Double`
*   **Behavior:** Writes to `position` only if the new value differs from the current value by more than `0.0009`.

### CRServo

**Extension Property:** `cachingPower`

*   **Type:** `Double`
*   **Behavior:** Writes to `power` only if the new value differs from the current value by more than `0.009`. Always writes if the new value is exactly `0.0`.
